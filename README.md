# Data Goes Where Privacy Policy

The *Data Goes Where* browser extension collects data exclusively for your use and sends none of it to us. None. Nil. Squat. Zero. Zilch. Zip.

Since we don't collect any of your data, we don't share your data with anyone. Nobody. We can't share it because we don't have it.

Why have a privacy policy that describes what we do with the data we collect if we don't collect any? Surveillance capitalists appear to have been unable to imagine that someone might ever do this. So, well, here we are with privacy policies for code that runs entirely on your computer and sends no data to us.

At some point it might make sense for us to collect telemetry to make Data Goes Where work better for you. This is the point where the privacy policy would tell you that we reserve the right to notify that we are changing these terms terms at any time. That doesn't seem cool, though. If we have a good reason to start collecting data we will (imagine this!) *ask your permission first*.
